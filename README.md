listBuilder
===========

A Forge mod that builds a config list for WhatIsIt automatically from gamedata.

Origonaly built against Forge .953.

Instructions for use:

Drop the jar in your mods directory, launch Minecraft, and log into any world.  After that, a file will be generated in your <minecraft>/config directory named "names.yml".  This is not the full file, it only contains the Block, Item, and Enchantment ID's from your modded minecraft.  You'll have to paste it into your existing names.yml in <minecraft>/plugins/WhatIsIt/
